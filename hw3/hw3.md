1. $G_0 = A_0 * B_0$.   
   Both $A_0$ and $B_0$ are available at 0T   
   Delay = $2T$, the delay of 1 AND gate

2. $P_0 = A_0 \oplus B_0$.  
   Delay = $2T$, the delay of 1 XOR gate


3. $G_{\alpha}$ = $G_0 * P_1 * P_2 * P_3 + G_1 * P_2 * P_3 + G_2 * P_3 + G_3$  
   Delay = Delay of 4-input OR gate + maximum delay of the 4 inputs = 5T + max(5T+2T, 3T+2T, 2T+2T, 2T) = 12T

4. $P_{\alpha}$ = $P_0 * P_1 * P_2 * P_3$  
   Delay = Delay of 4-input AND gate = 7T

5. $C_{12} = G_{\gamma} + G_{\beta} * P_{\gamma} + G_{\alpha} * P_{\beta} * P_{\gamma} + C_0 * P_{\alpha} * P_{\beta} * P_{\gamma}$  
   The output OR gate has delay 5T  
   Each Propagator P has delay 7T  
   Each Generator G has delay 12T  
   Delay = 5T + max(12T, 2T + max(12T, 7T), 3T + max(12T, 7T, 7T), 5T + max(0T, 7T, 7T, 7T)) = 5T + 15T = 20T

   Delay = 7T + max(12T, 2T + max(12T, 7T), 3T + max(12T, 7T, 7T), 5T + max(12T, 7T, 7T, 7T), 7T + max(0T, 7T, 7T, 7T, 7T)) = 7T + max(12T, 14T, 15T, 17T, 14T) = 24T


8. $S_{15} = A_{15} \oplus B_{15} \oplus C_{15}$  
   Delay = 3T + 30T = 33T

9.  $C_{20} = G_{19} + G_{18} * P_{19} + G_{17} * P_{18} * P_{19} + G_{16} * P_{17} * P_{18} * P_{19} + C_{16} * P_{16} * P_{17} * P_{18} * P_{19}$  
    For the CSA, $C_{16}$ has delay 0T. The output is generated by a 5-input OR gate.  
    Delay = 7T + max(2T, 2T+2T, 3T+2T, 5T+2T, 7T+2T) = 7T + 9T = 16T

10. $C_{19} = G_{18} + G_{17} * P_{18} + G_{16} * P_{17} * P_{18} + C_{16} * P_{16} * P_{17} * P_{18}$
    For the CSA, $C_{16}$ has delay 0T. The output is generated by a 4-input OR gate.  
    Delay = 5T + max(2T, 2T+2T, 3T+2T, 5T+2T) = 5T+7T = 12T

    $S_{19} = A_{19} \oplus B_{19} \oplus C_{19}$  
    Delay = 3T + max(0T, 0T, 12T) = 15T

11. $C_{24} = G_{23} + G_{22} * P_{23} + G_{21} * P_{22} * P_{23} + G_{20} * P_{21} * P_{22} * P_{23} + C_{20} * P_{20} * P_{21} * P_{22} * P_{23}$  
    Delay = 7T + max(2T, 2T+2T, 3T+2T, 5T+2T, 7T+16T) = 7T + 23T = 30T

12. $C_{31} = G_{30} + G_{29} * P_{30} + G_{28} * P_{29} * P_{30} + C_{28} * P_{28} * P_{29} * P_{30}$  
    
    $C_{28} = G_{27} + G_{26} * P_{27} + G_{25} * P_{26} * P_{27} + G_{24} * P_{25} * P_{26} * P_{27} + C_{24} * P_{24} * P_{25} * P_{26} * P_{27}$

    Delay of $C_{28}$ = 7T + max(2T, 2T+2T, 3T+2T, 5T+2T, 7T+30T) = 44T 

    Delay of $C_{31}$ = 5T + max(2T, 2T+2T, 3T+2T, 5T+44T) = 54T 

13. Before MUX:  
    $C_{32} = G_{31} + G_{30} * P_{31} + G_{29} * P_{30} * P_{31} + G_{28} * P_{29} * P_{30} * P_{31} + C_{28} * P_{28} * P_{29} * P_{30} * P_{31}$  
    Delay = 7T + max(2T, 2T+2T, 3T+2T, 5T+2T, 7T+44T) = 58T

    The selection bit $C_{16}$ has delay 24T

    After MUX:
    $C_{32}$ = 4T + max(58T, 58T, 24T) = 62T

14. Before MUX:  
    $S_{31} = A_{31} \oplus B_{31} \oplus C_{31}$ = 3T + max(0T, 0T, 54T) = 57T

    After MUX:  
    $S_{31}$ = 4T + max(57T, 57T, 24T) = 61T

15. The maximal delay is the max latency of these 3 outputs:
    
    $S_{0} - S_{15}$ from the 16-bit HCLA. Max latency is 33T from $S_{15}$  
    $S_{16} - S_{31}$ from MUX of the 16-bit CSA. Max latency is 61T from $S_{31}$  
    $C_{31}$ from MUX of the 16-bit CSA. Latency is 62T  

**So Maximal Delay = max(33T, 61T, 62T) = 62T**
